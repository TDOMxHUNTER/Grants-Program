# Project Name: Valhalla
# Project Overview
Valhalla is an open, community-driven platform launching first on Monad and expanding to multiple chains. We're building a collection of decentralized DApps, including a creator-owned NFT launchpad (with zero deployment fees), a GameFi DEX with unique token mining and rewards mechanics, and practical staking features.

Our vision is to level the playing field for creators, developers, and users—letting anyone launch and own their own NFT deployments. We're focused on transparency, sustainability, and honest engagement, building both fun and utility into the user experience.

# Motivation and Rationale

We believe that innovation in Web3 should be accessible and fair:

Most NFT launchpads own the contracts. Valhalla makes contract ownership default for creators—no platform lock-in, zero deployment fee.

Typical airdrops/grinding are unfair; our miner-based token model lets people actively “mine” their allocations (no bots, no spam, true proof-of-participation).

All mining proceeds go directly into the token’s initial liquidity at launch, so the community builds the liquidity pool themselves.

GameFi and random rewards turn every swap or stake into an engaging ecosystem event.

Integration with Monad’s validator data fills a real data-access gap, helping users participate with confidence.

# Deliverables & Milestones

Release of the zero-fee, creator-owned NFT launchpad (with marketplace onboarding)

Launch the miner-based token module (users mine allocations, mining fees → launch liquidity)

GameFi-enabled DEX (token swapping, two-tier reward structure)

Staking dashboard—support for Monad native tokens, including validator API integration

Heimdall AI chatbot (best ai models to provide best type of answer in the testing phase will be released soon) to onboard and assist users/creators

Public testnet with community campaign and feedback loops (Discord, Twitter, bug bounty)

Weekly ecosystem contributor calls and transparent reporting (community health, progress)

# Technical Architecture

Smart contracts: EVM-compatible, built for Monad (and easily portable to other chains)

Frontend: Next.js, React (Vercel hosted)

Backend/API: Node.js, custom API modules

Token miner logic: open-sourced Solidity contracts, on-chain mining interface

Heimdall AI: On-platform assistant using open-source LLaMA, running in browser/cloud

Funding Request
Amount: $10,000–$20,000 (due to milestone-based DOT vesting structure—see below)

If paid up front, $5,000–$10,000 would be sufficient; with half vesting over two years, increased ask is needed to ensure our team and platform can operate consistently.

# Money Breakdown (Estimate)

Smart contract development (NFT launchpad, miner, DEX): $1,200

Explanation: Monad is currently in its testnet phase, so development and deployment costs are minimal compared to mainnet environments. Most expenses here are for code, testing, and future portability.

Frontend + Backend development: $2,000

Team salaries (core members): $2,400

Breakdown: 3 core team members at $200/month for 4 months.

Intern onboarding and growth: $300

We plan to onboard interns at $50/month. If they demonstrate competency and value, we will upgrade them to a $200/month core role to support project growth and community expansion.

AI assistant (Heimdall) integration: $1,500

Heimdall will use an open-source AI model for onboarding and user support. Grant funding will help us integrate and optimize the assistant for developer and creator needs.

Public testnet hosting, bug bounty, documentation: $2,000

Community grants, liquidity pool seeding, launch rewards: $2,100

Total ask: $9,500 (for initial phase) – however, due to the vesting structure of milestone payouts, we request up to $20,000 to ensure transparent operation and team stability across the vesting period.

# Open Source Commitment

All core smart contracts (launchpad, DEX, token miner), the Heimdall AI module, and the staking interface will be openly published under an MIT or similar open-source license. Documentation and support guides will accompany all releases.

# Multichain Vision

After establishing on Monad, we plan integration with Ethereum, Polygon, and other EVM chains. Users will be able to mint, stake, and engage using their preferred tokens/networks, all through Valhalla.

Risks and Mitigations
Market awareness: We’ll run proactive education and outreach to grow an organic user base, sharing all analytics and progress publicly.

On-chain miner novel attack risks: Contracts will be audited and tested on testnet first and engage community bug bounties.

Validator API: Building caching/explorer fallback layers.

# KPIs & Success Metrics

Number of unique NFT launches (creator-owned)

Funds raised through token mining and direct LP allocation at launch

Staking and DEX TVL

Active Discord/Twitter/in-app users, contributor retention
